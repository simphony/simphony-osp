## Issues

### Reporting bugs

When you find that something is not working, you can submit a bug report. This section provides guidelines on how to submit your report in a way that helps maintainers understand the problem and reproduce it. Submitting a good bug report is a key to have issues solved quickly.

#### Before submitting a bug report

1. Consider what is the possible cause of your issue. Sometimes the source of a problem is in the least expected place. For example, it could be in the ontology that you are using, in the network connection or in the software that a SimPhoNy wrapper is interacting with.
2. Check the [Q&A](https://github.com/simphony/osp-core/discussions/categories/q-a) section of the [discussions page](https://github.com/simphony/osp-core/discussions). Someone else might have already experienced the same issue and got an answer on how to solve it.
3. Search for similar issues on the [issue board](https://github.com/simphony/osp-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+). The problem may already have been reported. If you are having issues while using a specific SimPhoNy wrapper, beware that each SimPhoNy Wrapper has its own issue board.

### Submitting a bug report

Bug reports should be submitted on the [SimPhoNy issue board](https://github.com/simphony/osp-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+).  If you suspect that the issue has its origin in the code of a specific wrapper, rather than in SimPhoNy itself, visit the issue board of the wrapper instead. To create a new report, click the green [_"New"_](https://github.com/simphony/osp-core/issues/new/choose) button.

- [ ] Choose a meaningful title.
- [ ] Describing the problem in few words.
- [ ] Specify which version of the `simphony-osp` is affected. Use `pip show simphony-osp` to find out which version do you have installed. If the problem involves a wrapper, provide also the version of the wrapper.
- [ ] Explain how to reproduce the problem, step-by-step, and include a **minimal reproducible example**. A _minimal reproducible example_ is a code snippet where the issue can be observed. Include any additional files (e.g. an ontology file) that may be needed to execute the example. Skip the example _only if it is very difficult to provide it_.
- [ ] If the issue involves a crash or an exception, include the error message.

[Follow this link](https://github.com/simphony/osp-core/issues/740#issue-1107800007) to see an example of an accurate bug report. Providing a good bug report facilitates the work of the maintainers and enables them to solve the issue faster.

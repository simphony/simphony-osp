      - icon: that stand for an object due to similitudes e.g. in shape or composition\n\
      \nCOMMENT:\nIn a 4D ontology one could question if a 'sign' should be defined\
      \ as a spatial direct part of a 'semiosis' i.e. a proper part of a 'semiosis'\
      \ during all its existence.\n\ne.g. one can say that an unread text is not a\
      \ 'sign': it was a 'sign' during the 'semiosis' process in which it was written,\
      \ but after that it is something else, until somebody read it again.\n\nHowever,\
      \ this is not the case for an ontology, since declaring an individual under\
      \ the 'sign' class (a semiosis outside the EMMO, a meta-semiosis) is equivalent\
      \ to say that for the ontologist (an interpreter outside the EMMO, a meta-interpreter)\
      \ the real entity (an object outside the EMMO, a meta-object) is a 'sign'.\n\
      \nSo the 'semiosis' process within the EMMO is about how other 'interpreter'-s\
      \ deal with the 'sign'-s here declared.\n\nCOMMENT:\nIt can be defined as the\
      \ semiotic branch of the EMMO.\n\n'sign' subclasses categorize the type of signs\

      \nEXAMPLE:\nA novel is made of chapters, paragraphs, sentences, words and characters\
      \ (in a direct parthood mereological hierarchy). \n\nEach of them are 'sign'-s.\
      \ \n\nA character can be the a-tomistic 'sign' for the class of texts.\n\nThe\
      \ horizontal segment in the character \"A\" is direct part of \"A\" but it is\
      \ not a 'sign' itself.\n\nFor plain text we can propose the ASCII symbols, for\
      \ math the fundamental math symbols.\"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral>"

      \nA non-perceivable real world entity does not exist (or it exists on a plane\

      \ it).\n\nPerception/observation of a real wolrd entity occurs when the entity\

      \ process which involves a specific observer with its own perception mechanisms.\n\
      \nThe observation process (e.g. a look, a photo shot, a measurement) is performed\
      \  by an observer (e.g. you, a camera, an instrument) through a specific perception\
      \ mechanism (e.g. retina impression, CMOS excitation, piezoelectric sensor activation)\

      \nThis definition can be generalized by using a generic human eye, so that the\

      A 'physical' must include at least an 'elementary' part, but can also include\
      \ void parts.\n\nA 'physical' may include as part also the 'void' surrounding\
      \ or enclosed by its 'physical' sub parts.\n\nThere are no particular criteria\
      \ for 'physical'-s structure, except that is made of some 'elementary'-s as\
      \ proper parts and not only 'void'.\n\nThis is done in order to:\na) take into\
      \ account the quantum nature of physical systems, in which the actual position\
      \ of sub-components (e.g. electrons in an atom) is not known except for its\
      \ probability distribution function (according to the Copenhagen interpretation.)\n\
      b) take into account the fact that large entities (e.g. devices, cars, materials)\
      \ have some void into them.\n\ne.g. a 'spacetime' that has spatial parts an\
      \ atom and a cubic light year of 'void' extending for some time can be a 'physical'\
      \ individual.\n\nCOMMENT:\nA 'physical' with dimensions other than 3D+1D (i.e.\
      \ 'physical' and not 'spacetime') cannot exist, since perception is a process\
      \ (unfolds in time). \n\nFor this reason, 'physical'-s exist only in space and\
      \ time (3D + 1D), so 'physical' is a subclass of 'spacetime'.\n\ne.g. you always\
      \ have an aperture time when you take a picture or measure a property. Instantaneous\
      \ perceptions are idealizations (abstractions) or a very small time measurement.\n\
      \nCOMMENT:\nIn the EMMO there are no relations such as 'occupies_space', since\
      \ 'physical'-s are themselves 'spacetime' entities.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe EMMO can\
      \ be used to represent real world entities as 'physical'-s that are easy to\
      \ connect to classical or quantum mechanical based models.\n\nClassical mechanics\
      \ poses no representational issues, for the EMMO: the 4D representation of 'physical'-s\
      \ is consistent with classical physics systems.\n\nHowever, the representation\
      \ of 'physical'-s that are typically analized through quantum mechanics (e.g.\
      \ molecules, atoms, clusters), is not straightforward.\n\n1) De Broglie - Bohm\
      \ interpretation\nThe most simple approach is to rely on Bohmian mechanics,\
      \ in which each particle is supposed to exists in a specific position between\
      \ measurements (hidden variables approach), while its trajectory is calculated\
      \ using a Guiding Equation based on a quantum field calculated with the Schroedinger\
      \ Equation.\n\nWhile this approach is really easy to implement in an ontology,\
      \ since each entity has its own well defined 4D region, its mathematical representation\
      \ failed to receive large consensus due to the difficulties to include relativistic\
      \ effects, to be extended to subnuclear scale and the strong non-locality assumtpion\
      \ of the quantum field.\n\nNevertheless, the Bohmian mechanics is a numerical\
      \ approach that is used in electronic models to reduce the computational effort\
      \ of the solution of Schroedinger Equation.\n\nIn practice, an EMMO user can\
      \ declare a 'physical' individual that stand for the whole quantum system to\
      \ be described, and at the same time all sub-parts individuals can be declared,\
      \ having them a well defined position in time, according to De Broglie - Bohm\
      \ interpretation. The Hamiltonian can be calculated by considering the sub-part\
      \ individuals.\n\n'physical'-s are then made of 'physical' parts and 'void'\
      \ parts that stand for the space between 'physical'-s (e.g. the void between\
      \ electrons and nucleus in an atom).\n\n2) Copenhagen interpretation\nIn this\
      \ interpretation the properties (e.g. energy level, position, spin) of a particle\
      \ are not defined in the interval between two measurements and the quantum system\
      \ is entangled (i.e. properties of particles in the sysyem are correlated) and\
      \ described by a global wavefunction obtained solving the Schroedinger Equation.\
      \ \n\nUpon measurement, the wavefunction collapses to a combination of close\
      \ eigenstates that provide information about bservables of the system components\
      \ (e.g. position, energy).\n\nThe EMMO can be used to represent 'physical'-s\
      \ that can be related to Copenhagen based models. In practice, the user should\
      \ follow these steps:\n\na) define the quantum system as a 'physical' individual\
      \ (e.g. an H2 molecule) under a specific class (e.g. 'h2_molecule'). This individual\
      \ is the whole.\n\nb) define the axioms of the  class that describe how many\
      \ sub-parts are expected for the whole and their class types (e.g. 'h2_molecule'\
      \ has axioms 'has_proper_part exactly 2 electron' and 'has_proper_part exactly\
      \ 2 nucleus)\n\nc) the user can now connect the whole to a Schroedinger equation\
      \ based model whose Hamiltonian is calculated trough the information coming\
      \ only from the axioms. No individuals are declared for the subparts!\n\nd)\
      \ a measurement done on the quantum system that provides information on the\
      \ sub-part observables is interpreted as wavefunction collapse and leads to\
      \ the end of the whole and the declaration of the sub-parts individuals which\
      \ can be themselves other quantum systems \n\ne.g. if the outer electron of\
      \ the H2 molecule interacts with another entity defining its state, then the\
      \ whole that stands for the entangled H2 molecule becomes a 'physical' made\
      \ of an electron individual, a quantum system made of one electron and two nuclei\
      \ and the void between them.\n\ne.g. in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the\
      \ user represent the atom by un-entangling nucleus and electronic cloud. The\
      \ un-entanglement comes in the form of declaration of individual as parts.\n\
      \ne.g. the double slit experiment can be represent in the EMMO as:\na) before\
      \ the slit: a 'physical' that extend in space and has parts 'electron' and 'void',\
      \ called 'single_electron_wave_function'. 'electron' and 'void' are only in\
      \ the axioms and not decalred individuals.\nb) during slit passage: a 'physical'\
      \ made of one declared individual, the 'electron'.\nc) after the slit: again\
      \ 'single_electron_wave_function'\nd) upon collision with the detector:  'physical'\
      \ made of one declared individual, the 'electron'.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe purpose\
      \ of the 'physical' branch is to provide a representation of the real world\
      \ entities, while the models used to explain or predict the behaviour of the\
      \ entities lay under the 'semeion' branch.\n\nMore than one model can be connected\
      \ to the same 'physical'.\n\ne.g. Navier-Stokes or Euler equation applied to\
      \ the same fluid"

      \ water as direct part) then the appearance of a molecule coming from the ice\
      \ will cause a state to end and another state to begin.\"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#PlainLiteral>"

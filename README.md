# OSP core

Native implementation of the core cuds object and the class generation
by the SimPhoNy team at Fraunhofer IWM. Builds up on the previous
version, simphony-common (SimPhoNy, EU FP7 Project (Nr. 604005)
www.simphony-project.eu).

## Requirements

- PyYaml (on Windows, use <https://stackoverflow.com/a/33673823>) for parsing yaml files
- numpy for vector attributes of cuds
- websockets for the transport layer
- requests for sending CUDS to a server
- tox to run unittests
- unittest2 to run unittests
- pympler for the performance test
- responses for unittesting requests

## Installation

OSP-core is available on PyPI, so it can be installed using `pip`

```shell
pip install osp-core
```

For more detailed instructions, see [https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html](https://simphony.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Visualization of ontologies

We provide the tool `ontology2dot` to visualize your ontologies. You can visualize installed namespaces together with non-installed yaml files (requires Graphviz https://graphviz.gitlab.io/):

```sh
ontology2dot <installed-namespace-1> ... <installed-namespace-n> <path/to/ontology-1.yml> ... <path/to/ontology-m.yml>

# Alternative
python -m osp.core.tools.ontology2dot <installed-namespace-1> ... <installed-namespace-n> <path/to/ontology-1.yml> ... <path/to/ontology-m.yml>
```

You can use parameter `-g` to group the namespaces. Use `-o` to change the filename of the resulting png file.

## Testing

Testing is done using tox (`pip install tox`):

```sh
# run tests automatically in different environments
tox

# run tests in your current environment (you must manually install unittest2, responses for that)
python -m unittest -v
```

## Documentation

Our documentation is located at <https://simphony.readthedocs.io>.

If you want to build the documentation locally, refer to our [documentation repostitory](https://github.com/simphony/docs).

### Examples

Further examples can be found in the /examples folder. There the usage of wrappers is explained.

## Troubleshooting

If installation fails, try to install the dependencies one by one before installing osp-core.
The dependencies are listed at the top of this readme file.

On Windows, unittests can fail when you use a virtual environment.
For testing the transport layer, we start a transport layer server using pythons subprocess package.
It can happen, that the started subprocess does not pick up the correct virtual environment, causing the server to crash and the corresponding tests to fail.
From our experience, this will not happen if you use the virtual environements of conda.

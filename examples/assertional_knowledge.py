"""Example showing how to access, edit and navigate assertional knowledge.

This example focuses on accessing, editing and navigating assertional
knowledge. In particular, a few ontology individuals that stand for a city,
some of its neighborhoods and inhabitants are instantiated, and are later
connected and navigated.

Before running this example, make sure that the city and emmo
ontologies are installed. If it is not the case, install them running the
following code:
>>> from simphony_osp.tools.pico import install
>>> install("city", "emmo")

# instantiate ontology individuals

"""An example showing how to use `pico` to manage the installed ontologies.

> SimPhoNy works with data that is based on ontologies. In particular, all
> information is represented in terms of ontology individuals that belong to
> specific ontology classes, have specific attributes and can be connected to
> other individuals through relationships. Classes, attributes and
> relationships are defined in the ontologies. Therefore, in order for SimPhoNy
> to be able to properly interpret the data, such ontologies need to be made
> available to it. For that purpose, SimPhoNy includes an ontology management
> tool called pico.

> Ontologies can be added to SimPhoNy by installing ontology packages, which
> are YAML configuration files that, in addition to pointing to the actual
> ontology files, also define extra metadata.

========
Native implementation of the core cuds object and the class generation by the SimPhoNy team at Fraunhofer IWM.
Builds up on the previous version, simphony-common (SimPhoNy, EU FP7 Project (Nr. 604005) www.simphony-project.eu)

Requirements
------------
- PyYaml (on Windows, use https://stackoverflow.com/a/33673823)

\*To run cuds2dot, `graphviz` must be installed in the system::

    sudo apt-get install graphviz

If you want to visualise the graph in a more interactive way than just the png, `xdot` can be used::

    sudo apt-get install xdot

Installation
------------
The package requires python 3 (tested for 3.6), installation is based on setuptools::

    # build and install
    python3 setup.py install

    # using toy ontology
    python3 setup.py install -t

or::

    # build for in-place development
    python3 setup.py develop

Testing
-------
Testing is included in setuptools::

    # run tests automatically
    python3 setup.py test

They can also be run manually::

    # manually run tests
    python3 -m cuds.testing.test_api

Entry points
------------
There is an entry point for the *cuds2dot* tool for graph generation. Use `cuds2dot -h` for help.

The *class generator* can also be run with different ontologies and/or template files.
The idea is that the users can define their own ontology and compare with the stable one.
The new one will not be added to the python site-packages, and can be imported through relative paths.

If the generated classes are to be added to python for easier importing, the output folder can be set to `site-packages`:
.. code:: python

    import site
    print(site.getsitepackages())[0] + "/cuds/classes/generated")

Documentation
-------------
TODO

Directory structure
-------------------
- cuds -- files necessary for the creation and usage of the cuds.

  - classes -- python classes required for using the cuds.

    - core -- common low level classes and utility code.
    - generated -- generated native cuds implementations.

  - metatools -- class generator and template file.
  - ontology -- ontological representation of the cuds.

    - tools -- scripts that work on the ontology files
  - testing -- unittesting of the code.
- doc -- documentation related files.
- examples -- examples of usage.

Data structure
--------------
Each cuds object is represented as a registry (dictionary).

Each entry will enclose the elements contained by said object with the same CUBA key.

These will be again in a registry, this time by UID.

For example:
.. code:: JSON

    a_cuds_object = {

        "CUBA_key1": {"uid1": cuds_object1, "uid2": cuds_object2},
        "CUBA_key2": {"uid3": cuds_object3},
        "CUBA_key3": {"uid4": cuds_object4, "uid5": cuds_object5, "uid6": cuds_object6}

    }
